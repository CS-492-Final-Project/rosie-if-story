			<h1>Why make this game?</h1>
			As part of our<a href="https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs492/" target="_blank"
				>CS492: The Social Implications of Computing</a
			> final group project at the University of Waterloo, we were asked to explore a social issue concerning
			artificial intelligence (AI), and we took interest in the increasing prominence of AI within the
			realm of dating. We ultimately wanted to explore the implications that using an AI dating assistant
			might have on authenticity, social connectedness, and privacy. Our team has strengths with art,
			as well as an interest with writing and games, so we felt like an interactive fiction game would
			be a perfect medium for doing so.

			<h1>Does something like Rosie exist?</h1>
			While there is currently nothing like Rosie which helps with dating in real-time undetectably,
			many dating services - both existing and new - are already rushing to integrate AI capabilities
			into their products. The most notable type are profile curators, where AI can help redesign entire
			profiles to maximize chances of dating success. Furthermore, more people are consulting LLMs like
			ChatGPT for dating advice, which if acted upon, could be risky. It is our belief that the scope
			of AI integration with dating services will continue to increase as more and more companies seek
			to ride the AI hype train and promote "novel" solutions for profit, likely at the expense of its
			users.

			<h1>Where can I learn more?</h1>
			There was a lot of background research conducted for this project, but to keep things short, here
			are some readings we would recommend the most:

			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/730709" target="_blank"
						>How AI Constrains the Human Experience</a
					>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a
						href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Algorithmic+Intimacy%3A+The+Digital+Revolution+in+Personal+Relationships-p-9781509549825"
						target="_blank"
						>Algorithmic Intimacy: The Digital Revolution in Personal Relationships</a
					>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a
						href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/artificial-intelligence-relationships-1.7148866"
						target="_blank"
						>From AI dating to flirt coaches: How AI is changing dating, for better or worse</a
					>
				</li>
			</ul>
			We would probably recommend above all, however, to evaluate your relationship with AI and ask yourself:
			has AI really helped me grow as a person? Does it make me more capable of relationships?
